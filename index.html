    <h3><strong><br><br>Behavior</strong></h3>
    <p><br><br>Dog behavior is influenced by a complex interplay of instincts, learned behaviors, and environmental factors. Dogs, descended from wolves, retain many pack-oriented behaviors such as hierarchy establishment, territoriality, and social bonding. They communicate primarily through body language, vocalizations, and scent marking. Tail wagging, for instance, can indicate excitement, while growling may signal discomfort or aggression. Dogs also exhibit strong social tendencies, forming bonds with humans and other animals. Training and socialization play crucial roles in shaping their behavior, impacting everything from obedience to their ability to interact positively with others. Understanding and respecting a dog's natural behaviors is key to fostering a healthy and harmonious relationship between humans and their canine companions.</p>
